# Reddit Viewer SPA
This is a Single Page Application built with [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) and [Redux](https://github.com/reactjs/react-redux) that allows you to view content from Reddit.  The application styling uses [Google's Material Design Lite](https://getmdl.io/) and [Materalize CSS](http://materializecss.com/).


### Getting Started

### Navigating

Once initialized the application can be accesed via port `8080` on `localhost`. The application is driven primarily by react-router, allowing you to access routes to get directly to the content you want. For example `http://localhost:8080/r/teslamotors/hot` or `http://localhost:8080/r/wow/new`.
